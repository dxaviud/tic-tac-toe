# tictactoe

## About
This is my implementation of tic tac toe using Java. It is console based.

## Execute
Make sure that [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) is installed. Clone this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file TicTacToeStarter.java and run `javac TicTacToeStarter.java` to compile the java files into bytecode (.class files), then `java TicTacToeStarter` to execute the program.
